   <center><h1>AUTHENTIC CHICKEN CURRY</h1></center>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Bone-in Chicken</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>An authentic Indian chicken curry is cooked with a whole chicken cut into pieces. Bone-in meat is the essence of Indian meat curries. I highly recommend using whole chicken cut into pieces for this recipe. Boneless chicken breast is a good substitute for bone-in chicken pieces.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Tomatoes</b></li>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Roma</li>
            <li>Vine</li>
            <ul>
                <li> I usually like to use pureed Roma or Vine tomatoes. Remove the seeds before pureeing them so you don't have to sieve them</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Ginger & Garlic</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Grate the ginger and garlic or mince them in a food processor. I like to make and store large batches of ginger-garlic paste. It comes in handy in my kitchen.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Onion</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to thinly slice the yellow onion for chicken curry. That's how my mother did. You may run it through the chopper if you want.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Oil</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li> A generous amount of oil is a sign of rich and authentic Indian curry. I am using ½ cup of oil but you may adjust according to your desired quantity.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>WHOLE & GROUND SPICE</b></li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Whole cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li> Bay leaves</li>
            <li>green cardamom</li>
            <li>clova</li>
            <li>Black peppercorns</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I am using pink salt and measurements are based on pink salt. Use salt per your taste and the type of salt you may use.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Gram masala</li>
            <ul>
                <li> I only use homemade garam masala for meat curry recipes. My homemade garam masala is the key ingredient in this recipe. Whenever a South Asian has tried my chicken curry, they have always asked for the recipe for my garam masala. It's a game-changer, I promise!</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps to make it</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Marinade the boneless chicken breast pieces with all the listed powdered spices, ginger-garlic, and whole spices</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy-bottom pan over high heat. Add the oil to the pan. Once the oil starts to heat up, add chopped onions, and ½ teaspoon of salt to the pan.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to medium and sauté the onions until golden. It takes about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add marinated chicken to the pan. Sauté until chicken is no longer pink. </li>
        <li>Add tomato puree and stir well.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or just until the chicken is tender. </li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve it with plain rice, roti, or naan.</li>
    </ul>
